# Memoria

Memoria is a self-hosted application that automatically detects recently deceased actors and public figures, and creates curated collections in your Plex libraries.

The goal is simple: keep your media library up to date with meaningful "In Memoriam" collections — fully automated.

---

## ✨ Features

- Detect recently deceased people (actors, directors, etc.)
- Automatically match them with your Plex library content
- Create and manage Plex collections per library (Movies / TV Shows)
- Use the person’s photo as the collection poster
- Fully automated background jobs
- Configurable retention (auto-remove after X days)
- Manual addition of people (with automatic metadata correction)
- Integration with TMDB for accurate data

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Memoria fetches recently deceased people from external sources  
2. It enriches data using TMDB (names, images, metadata)  
3. It scans your Plex libraries to find matching media  
4. It creates or updates collections in Plex:
   - One collection per person  
   - One per library (Movies / TV Shows)  
5. After a configurable delay, collections are automatically removed

- Posters are fetched from TMDB  
- No modification is made to your existing media files
